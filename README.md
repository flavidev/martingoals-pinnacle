# martingoals-pinnacle/
A React web app created to extract data from [Pinnacle](https://www.pinnacle.com/en) and scrape barely favorites from under/over goals market of Pinnacle website.

This application was developed to be played as a variation of martingale system. The main principle is to toss the "rigged" coin, your chances are bigger than 50% each time but your earns/risks are also smaller.  

```
/martingoals/backend/src/echo $'USERNAME=PINNACLE_USERNAME\nPASSWORD=PINNACLEPASSWORD\nINITIAL_DEPOSIT=YOUR_INITIAL_DEPOSIT' > .env

/martingoals/backend/yarn dev

/martingoals/frontend/yarn dev
